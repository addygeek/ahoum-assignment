        {"turn_id": 5, "speaker": "user", "text": "That sounds logical. What about handling dependencies between teams?"},
        {"turn_id": 6, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "Great question. I recommend weekly sync meetings and using a shared project board. Define clear API contracts early so teams can work in parallel."}

        {"turn_id": 2, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "No, we cannot make that conclusion. This is a logical fallacy. While all roses are flowers, the flowers that fade quickly might not include any roses. We only know that some flowers fade quickly, but not which ones."},

        {"turn_id": 4, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "Then yes! If all flowers fade quickly, and all roses are flowers, then by logical deduction (syllogism), all roses would fade quickly. The universal quantifier 'all' makes this valid."},

        {"turn_id": 4, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "I completely understand your frustration with having to repeat yourself. I've located your order. I can see the issue now. Let me process a full refund and arrange for a replacement to be sent immediately."},

        {"turn_id": 2, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "Imagine you have two magic coins. When you flip one and it shows heads, the other one instantly shows tails, no matter how far apart they are. That's entanglement - two particles linked so that measuring one instantly affects the other."},
        {"turn_id": 3, "speaker": "user", "text": "But doesn't that break the speed of light rule?"},
        {"turn_id": 4, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "Great question! Actually, no information travels faster than light. While the correlation is instant, you can't use it to send a message because the outcomes are random. It's 'spooky action at a distance' as Einstein called it, but it doesn't violate relativity."},
        {"turn_id": 5, "speaker": "user", "text": "What are the practical applications?"},
        {"turn_id": 6, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "Entanglement is crucial for quantum computing, which could solve problems classical computers can't. It's also used in quantum cryptography for ultra-secure communication, and in quantum teleportation of information."}

        {"turn_id": 4, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "15 years is a profound connection. Your grief is valid. Remember, distance doesn't have to end a friendship. Many close friendships thrive across miles with calls, visits, and shared experiences online."},

        {"turn_id": 6, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "It will be different, and it's okay to mourn that change. Perhaps you could plan regular video calls, an annual visit, or even a shared online activity. The bond you've built over 15 years is resilient."}

        {"turn_id": 2, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "The issue is you're missing a base case! Your recursion never stops. Add a condition like: if n <= 1: return 1. Otherwise it keeps calling itself infinitely until the stack overflows."},
        {"turn_id": 3, "speaker": "user", "text": "Oh I see! So every recursive function needs a base case?"},
        {"turn_id": 4, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "Exactly! Every recursive function needs: 1) A base case that returns without recursing, 2) Recursive calls that move toward the base case. Without these, you get infinite recursion."},

        {"turn_id": 4, "speaker": "assistant", "text": "I understand the difficulty of that conversation. Perhaps framing it as 'I want to be more productive for the team' might help? Or suggesting a pilot of shorter, focused meetings with agendas?"},
