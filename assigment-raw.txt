Ahoum - Assignment (AI & ML)
Conversation Evaluation Task
Goal: Design a production-ready benchmark in which systems must score every conversation
turn on 300 distinct facets covering linguistic quality, pragmatics, safety and emotion.
Data size: 300 data points (should scale up to 5000 facets without architectural rewrites)
Score scale: Five ordered integers (don’t need to be 0-4 or 1-5)
Facet Dataset: Facets Assignment.csv
1. Clean & Preprocess the Data according to your requirement
2. Come up with additional columns which can help with the evaluation
Hard Constraints:
1. No one-shot prompt solutions
2. Must use open-weights licences (≤ 16B) (e.g., Llama 3-8B, Qwen2-8B, Mixtral 8×7B
MoE)
3. Architecture must support ≥ 5000 facets without redesign
Brownie Points:
1. Confidence outputs for each score
2. Dockerised baseline
3. Sample UI
Deliverables Checklist:
1. Github repository with proper documentation
2. Optional: Deployed url of the UI
3. A zip file containing at least 50 conversations covering various cases & their scores
